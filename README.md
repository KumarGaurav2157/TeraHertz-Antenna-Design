# TeraHertz-Antenna-Design
Designed and simulated a triple-band antenna system consisting of one wideband and two narrowband operating frequencies to support multi-band wireless communication. The antenna was optimized to achieve an excellent return loss of −47 dB, indicating high impedance matching and minimal signal reflection.
